## Let me in!

### ✅  Tasks:
- [ ] Add on to the HTTP Trigger in the previous issue to check if the user’s parameter input of “password” equals `letmein`. If it does, return "Access granted."
- [ ] If it doesn’t equal the correct password, the function should return “Access denied.”
- [ ] Place your function URL in a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) called `HTTP_ENDPOINT` so we can check your function. 
- [ ] Commit the function's code in a file named `letMeIn.js` to the root of the `week1` branch!

### Returning from a function?
Now that we've got the user's result, either `Access denied.` or `Access granted.`, we have to get it to them somehow. **We can do this by returning it in the body of the request!**

> :bulb: Recall the `context.res` object we saw in the HTTP Trigger template.

```js
context.res = {
    // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
    body: your_response
};
```
Place your message to the user in `your_response`!

### Guidelines
The function should output the following responses according to whichever case is true:
- Password is correct (letmein): `Access granted.`
- Password is incorrect: `Access denied.`
