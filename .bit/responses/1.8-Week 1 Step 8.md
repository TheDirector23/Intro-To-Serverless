<summary>:exclamation: Now that I've got everything, how do I return it?</summary>
    </br>

`context.res` is the key to answering this question!

To return your two images and two names in the output:
```js
context.res = {
    body: {
        cat1: your-first-catpicture-in-base64,
        cat2: your-second-catpicture-in-base64,
        names: [name1, name2]
    }
}
```
